# Hardhat_project
This is my first hardhat project with all the basic requirements needed for a project.

# Description 

Finally I have deployed my first hardhat project with all the use cases from the scratch to the end in my local desktop along with the test cases .
The main agenda behind the project was to get into the brief understanding of the Hardhat environment from the installation to the deployment of the code in the test net.
